Language Used -> C for Threading Concepts.

Instructions to Compile and Run the Code.
File 1: oddeven.c
	Compile: gcc oddeven.c -o oddeven
	Run: .\oddeven

File 2: sasaki.c
	Compile: gcc sasaki.c -o sasaki
	Run: .\sasaki

File 3: time_optimal.c
	Compile: gcc time_optimal.c -o time_optimal
	Run: .\time_optimal

On Runnig It will ask to Enter The Number of Process -> Enter the Number of Process ie. 10, 20, 30, 50.
Next,
	1. BEST CASE (SORTED)
	2. RANDOM SEQUENCE
	3. WORST CASE (REVERSELY SORTED)
	4. USER INPUT

Enter 1 for Best Case Input Generation.
Enter 2 for Random Sequence.
Enter 3 for Worst Case Generation.
Enter 4 for User Input Generation and can enter the value of each processor.


3 Program Files included
1) oddeven.c
2) sasaki.c
3) time_optimal.c

Outputs Included in Report File.

Time and space complexity of the algorithm with the specific choice of the data structures are included in the Report File.


Output:

Comparision Table.

Odd-Even:
10 -> 0.023000 
20 -> 0.077000
30 -> 0.171000
50 -> 0.406000

Sasaki's time-optimal:
10 -> 0.111000
20 -> 0.261000
30 -> 0.718000
50 -> 2.08200

An alternative time-optimal:
10 -> 0.03600
20 -> 0.13000
30 -> 0.62800
50 -> 0.90400


Necessary information for supporting the implementation is added in the Report File and 
Time, Space Complexity and specific choice of the data structures is added in the Report File.
